Certainly, here are the statements evaluated for whether they are propositions or not, along with justifications:

1. "Apples are typically red or green." (True/False?)

2. "Bananas are sweet and creamy in taste." (True/False?)
   - Proposition: True. This is a declarative statement that can be evaluated as true because bananas are known for their sweet and creamy taste.

3. "Oranges are an excellent source of Vitamin C." (True/False?)
   - Proposition: True. This is a declarative statement that can be evaluated as true because oranges are an excellent source of Vitamin C.

4. "Apples have a salty taste." (True/False?)
   - Proposition: True. This is a declarative statement that can be evaluated as false because, in reality, apples do not have a salty taste.

5. "I like oranges." (True/False?)
   - Proposition: False. The statement has an indefinite truth value, which can be either true or false, but not both.

6. "What fruits do you like?" (True/False?)
   - Proposition: False. It does not make a factual assertion. The statement is in the form of a question, specifically an open-ended question asking for information about someone's preferences.

7. "Banana something that with yellow color" (True/False?)
   - Proposition: False. The statement is unclear and does not make a specific and clear assertion about bananas. It is difficult to determine what the statement is trying to convey.
