Below are the propositions (A to E) for the fruit chatbot. These propositions can be used to represent various characteristics and attributes of different types of fruits in the chatbot's knowledge base. Convert the English sentences in parts (I) – (IV) into standard predicate logic sentences when given the following propositions:

A: x is a type of fruit.
B: x is a common color of fruits.
C: x is a fruit that is in season.
D: x has a specific nutritional value.
E: x is a fruit with a distinct aroma.

1. "Some fruits are in season." 
   - Predicate Logic: ∃x (C(x))

2. "All fruits have a common color." 
   - Predicate Logic: ∀x (B(x))

3. "There exist fruits with a distinct aroma." 
   - Predicate Logic: ∃x (E(x))

4. "Not all fruits are in season." 
   - Predicate Logic: ¬∀x (C(x))

5. "There exist fruits that are not in season." 
   - Predicate Logic: ∃x (¬C(x))

6. "No fruits have a distinct aroma." 
   - Predicate Logic: ¬∃x (E(x))

7. "Some fruits are not a type of fruit." 
   - Predicate Logic: ∃x (¬A(x))

7. "Banana something that with yellow color" (True/False?)
   - Proposition: False. The statement is unclear and does not make a specific and clear assertion about bananas. It is difficult to determine what the statement is trying to convey.
