Scenario Demonstrating Resolution Refutation in Predicate Logic:

Suppose we want to verify if a specific student, let's call them "Emily," has an appointment with a counselor:

Premises:
Student(Emily)
Advisor(Counselor)
Appointment(Emily, Counselor, January 15, 2023, 10:00 AM)

Statement to prove:
Appointment(Emily, Counselor, January 20, 2023, 2:00 PM)

Resolution Steps:
Convert premises to Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF).
Apply resolution to check if the statement holds true based on the existing knowledge base.

This would verify if Emily has an appointment with the counselor at the specified date and time, demonstrating how resolution refutation confirms or denies the addition of new knowledge to the KB regarding appointments.
